## Projects

### SHIP-ROLLING CONTROL 
This project was a part of my master's thesis. I've developed a control system for ship rolling stabilization. The system was based on a deep reinforcement learning that was trained on simulation data.

### CO2 EMISSION VIEWER
This project was a part of my research in part-time job. The purpose is to measure CO2 emissions from ships. I've developed a simple app that allows to visualize CO2 emissions data.
