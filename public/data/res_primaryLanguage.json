      "startDate": "2024",
      "description": "This study uses a Double-Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm to control ship speed and reduce parametric resonance risk under regular waves. Parametric rolling occurs when the pitch-roll frequency ratio is about 2:1. Using a 2DOF model, the study examines nonlinear pitch-roll coupling in head seas. The DDQN algorithm, trained on simulation data, effectively identifies high-risk scenarios and adjusts speed to mitigate parametric resonance, enhancing ship stability and safety in maritime navigation.",

      "content": "<h1>Objective of the Project</h1><p>Catching the amount of fish is an important aspect of the fishing industry and is highly influenced by various factors such as species, location, time, ship's velocity, and so on. The goal of this project is to analyze fishing catch data to identify trends and patterns in the data. The data is collected from a fishing vessel and includes information such as species, amount, date, and location.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The fishing industry plays a critical role in global food security and economy, providing a primary source of protein for millions of people worldwide. Understanding the factors that affect fish catch rates is essential for optimizing fishing efforts, ensuring sustainable practices, and maximizing yields. This project aims to delve into the data collected from fishing vessels to uncover insights into how various factors such as species, location, time, and ship's velocity influence the quantity of fish caught. By identifying these trends and patterns, we can contribute to more efficient and sustainable fishing practices.</p><h1>Method</h1><p>To achieve the objective of this project, we utilized data collected from monitoring devices installed on fishing vessels. These devices recorded detailed information about each fishing trip, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Species</strong>: The type of fish caught.</li><li><strong>Amount</strong>: The quantity of fish caught, measured in kilograms.</li><li><strong>Date</strong>: The specific date and time when the fishing activity took place.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: The geographical coordinates where the fishing occurred.</li><li><strong>Ship's Velocity</strong>: The speed of the vessel during the fishing activity.</li></ul><p>The data was stored in a structured format, allowing for comprehensive analysis. We employed various data analysis techniques, including statistical analysis and data visualization, to identify significant patterns and correlations in the data. Additionally, we considered environmental factors such as tides and currents to understand their impact on fishing success.</p><h1>Results</h1><p>The amount of fish caught is significantly influenced by both the tide and the speed of the vessel. When the vessel heads into the tide, catch rates often decrease compared to when the vessel follows the tide. Similarly, the vessel's speed plays a crucial role, with optimal speed ranges identified that maximize catch rates. Speeds that are too slow or too fast generally result in lower catches.</p><p>Different fish species respond differently to the environmental conditions of tides and vessel speed. Some species are more abundant when the vessel follows the tide, while others might be caught in greater numbers when heading into the tide. The speed of the vessel also affects species differently, emphasizing the need for species-specific fishing strategies.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The findings from this project underscore the importance of considering various factors that influence fishing success. By understanding the impact of tides, vessel speed, and species-specific behaviors on catch rates, fishing operations can be optimized to improve efficiency and yield. These insights can help fishermen make informed decisions, leading to more sustainable fishing practices and better resource management. Further research and continuous monitoring are recommended to refine these findings and adapt to changing environmental conditions.</p><p>This project demonstrates the value of data analysis in the fishing industry, providing a foundation for future studies and technological advancements aimed at enhancing fishing productivity and sustainability.</p><h1>Data Visualization</h1><p>Dashboard Link: <a href='https://tatsuhiro-portfolio.streamlit.app/Fishing_Catch_Viewer' target='_blank'>Fishing Catch Data Analysis</a></p>"
